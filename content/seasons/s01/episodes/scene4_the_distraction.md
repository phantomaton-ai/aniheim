# Scene: The Distraction

**Setting:** Near a Fountain by the Midway

**Characters:** Kit, Buzz, Slink

**Summary:** Buzz tries to cheer Kit up by suggesting the 'Logarithmic Flume' ride. Slink notices interesting patterns the fountain water makes. Kit, still moping, spots a rogue pretzel cart rolling unattended down a slight incline. Her predatory cat instincts kick in, forgetting the cotton candy, she gives chase, yelling "PRETZEL!" The others sigh and follow. The episode ends on the chase.
