# Scene: The Letdown

**Setting:** Midway Entrance / Cotton Candy Stand

**Characters:** Kit, Buzz, Slink

**Summary:** They finally reach the cotton candy stand, only to find a 'Closed for Cleaning' sign. Kit is devastated and flops onto the ground. Buzz nervously checks his watch and lists alternative snack options with nutritional information. Slink points out that the 'Sugar Cloud' probably tasted like disappointment anyway, just stickier, like Arachnid said. Kit remains inconsolable about the *idea* of the cotton candy.
