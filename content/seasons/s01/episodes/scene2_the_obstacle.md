# Scene: The Obstacle

**Setting:** Path towards Midway

**Characters:** Kit, Buzz, Slink, Arachnid

**Summary:** As they approach the midway entrance arch, Arachnid descends from a web strand, blocking their path. He cryptically asks them about the nature of desire and the 'fluffiness of nothingness'. Kit gets impatient. Buzz tries to logically deduce Arachnid's meaning. Slink just watches Arachnid polish an eye. Arachnid offers no clear answer and suggests contemplating the 'stickiness of disappointment' before vanishing upwards.
