# Pixel

*(Previously Metric/Vector)* A green tree python kid embodying **Iteration**. Precise, detail-oriented, pattern-obsessed, and deeply comforted by predictable loops and perfect repetition. **Non-binary**. Exhibits traits associated with the autism spectrum, particularly intense focus on specific interests and finding social nuances confusing unless presented as logical patterns.

**Backstory:** Pixel's family are highly skilled artisans working in the Aniheim Restoration Department, specializing in painstakingly restoring faded mosaic tilework, debugging corrupted pixel art on old arcade machines, and optimizing data compression for the park's digital archives. Pixel grew up surrounded by grids, algorithms, and the iterative process of refinement towards perfection.

**Physical Description:** A slender green python with smooth scales that have a subtle, almost digital-looking sheen. Moves with a precise, flowing quality, often tracing patterns on the ground or railings absentmindedly. Large, observant eyes that focus intently. Wears a simple, comfortable dark grey hoodie (zipper always pulled to the exact same spot) and custom-made glasses with perfectly clean lenses.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (Analyzing a pattern) "Fascinating. The wear pattern on these cobblestones repeats every 17 stones, with a 3-pixel deviation on cycles 4 and 11. It suggests an underlying resonant frequency from the tramway, modulated by... hmm... asynchronous tourist footfall."
*   (Processing social interaction) "Your statement 'Cheer up!' lacks actionable parameters. Request clarification: Specify desired emotional state delta, acceptable methods for state transition, and required duration of modified state."
*   (Finding solace) "This situation is deviating unpredictably. Initiating calming routine: Recite Fibonacci sequence to the 50th term. *Starts whispering* 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8..."
