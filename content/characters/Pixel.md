# Metric

*(Previously Vector)* A green tree python kid embodying **Sequence**, but applied to physical performance and strategy. Methodical, analytical, and focused on achieving goals through disciplined training and adherence to proven techniques. **Masculine**. Believes in practice, precedent, and quantifiable results.

**Backstory:** Metric's family manages the Aniheim Sports Archives & Performance Institute within the Chronos Tower. They analyze historical game footage, codify winning strategies, and develop optimal training sequences. Metric lives by the stats, the playbooks, and the relentless pursuit of perfected form based on historical success.

**Physical Description:** A muscular (for a snake) green python. Carries himself with a coiled readiness. Often seen practicing specific movements or stretches. Wears a high-quality, moisture-wicking athletic zip-up top (usually grey or black) and maybe sweatbands on his upper body/tail near the head. Always appears focused and ready for action.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (Planning an action) "Okay team, the standard procedure for pretzel cart interception, Playbook 7, Section 3a: Approach vector at 45 degrees, maintain low profile, intercept before Apex C. Execute on three. Ready? One..."
*   (Analyzing failure) "Reviewing the sequence: Initial velocity was adequate, but the friction coefficient of the pavement was underestimated by 0.08. We need to adjust the thrust calculation for attempt two."
*   (Critiquing) "Your form is sloppy. The archives show that Hall-of-Famer 'Coil' Johnson never deviated more than 3 degrees from the optimal spine angle during the Great Churro Climb of '78. Discipline!"
