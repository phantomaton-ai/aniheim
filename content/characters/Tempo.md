# Tempo

*(Previously Buzz)* A honeybee kid embodying **Iteration**. Meticulous, detail-oriented, and focused on process and efficiency. Views the world as a system to be optimized and understood through careful repetition and adherence to rules.

**Backstory:** Tempo's family has worked for generations within the Aniheim Parks Operations Guild, specializing in ride maintenance schedules, crowd flow analysis, and horticultural timekeeping. They live by checklists and preventative maintenance. Tempo internalizes this, constantly seeking patterns, measuring efficiency, and worrying about deviations from the expected process.

**Physical Description:** A compact, sturdy-looking bee. Keeps antennae neatly groomed. Wears clean, practical khaki overalls with precisely organized pockets containing small tools, a measuring tape, and a miniature clipboard. Sturdy, sensible brown work boots. Keeps tiny aviator goggles (a guild heirloom) polished and pushed up on the forehead. Moves with a purposeful, steady rhythm.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (Analyzing a situation) "According to my calculations, based on the current queue trajectory and average guest velocity, the optimal time to join the line for the 'Logarithmic Flume' was precisely 4 minutes and 17 seconds ago. We've deviated."
*   (Seeing a problem) "Procedure 7B clearly states that discarded churro crumbs must be cleared within a 5-minute interval! This is suboptimal! I should file a report."
*   (Comforting) "There, there. While this outcome is statistically disappointing, we can iterate. Let's review the process, identify the point of failure, and implement corrective measures for the next attempt." *Starts buzzing slightly*
