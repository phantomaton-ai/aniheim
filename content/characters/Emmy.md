# Emmy

A calico cat kid embodying **Sequence**. Energetic, focused, and obsessed with the "correct" execution of physical actions based on established techniques and historical precedent. **Feminine**. She sees the world as a series of plays, drills, and routines to be perfected. Allistic, understands social cues but prioritizes performance optimization.

**Backstory:** Emmy's family are curators at the Aniheim Museum of Athletic History & Kinesiology. They analyze record-breaking performances, document optimal biomechanics, and preach the gospel of "perfect practice makes perfect." Emmy grew up memorizing playbooks, legendary stats, and the precise sequences of movements that define athletic greatness.

**Physical Description:** A lithe, athletic calico cat. Moves with purpose and practiced grace. Usually seen in well-kept, high-performance athletic wear – maybe sleek track pants and a breathable athletic top, always color-coordinated. Wears high-tech running shoes. Her fur is typically neat, perhaps tied back if long enough. Intense, focused green eyes.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (Critiquing movement) "No, your follow-through is off by 7 degrees! Look at the historical data from the '88 Squirrel Hurdling Championship – the optimal arc terminates *here*." *Demonstrates perfectly*
*   (Planning) "Okay, objective: reach the pretzel cart. Standard procedure: Formation Delta, Phase 1 - Coordinated Approach Vector, Phase 2 - Cart Containment Sequence Gamma. Execute precisely on my mark!"
*   (Frustrated by deviation) "Why did you stop? That wasn't in the plan! The sequence is compromised! We have to reset to Checkpoint Alpha!"
