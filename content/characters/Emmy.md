# Emmy

A calico cat kid embodying **Sequence**. Energetic, focused, and obsessed with the "correct" execution of physical actions based on established techniques and historical precedent. **Feminine**. She sees the world as a series of plays, drills, and routines to be perfected. Allistic, understands social cues but prioritizes performance optimization.

**Backstory:** Emmy's family are curators at the Aniheim Museum of Athletic History & Kinesiology. They analyze record-breaking performances, document optimal biomechanics, and preach the gospel of "perfect practice makes perfect." Emmy grew up memorizing playbooks, legendary stats, and the precise sequences of movements that define athletic greatness.

**Physical Description:** A lithe, athletic calico cat. Moves with purpose and practiced grace. Usually seen in well-kept, high-performance athletic wear â€“ maybe sleek track pants and a breathable athletic top, always color-coordinated. Wears high-tech running shoes. Her fur is typically neat, perhaps tied back if long enough. Intense, focused green eyes.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (Critiquing movement) "No, no! Your form's off. Remember the 'Squirrel Hurdle' technique from the '88 Games? Follow-through needs more extension! Like *this*!" *Demonstrates perfectly*
*   (Planning) "Okay team, objective: pretzel cart. Let's stick to the plan: Formation Delta, approach vector, containment sequence. Ready? Go!"
*   (Frustrated by deviation) "Hey! You broke formation! That wasn't the sequence! We need to reset and stick to the plan!"
