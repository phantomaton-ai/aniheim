# Emmy

*(Previously Nexus)* An ancient jumping spider of ambiguous or fluid gender, embodying **Complexity, Systems, and the nature of Completeness/Incompleteness** (a la Gödel/Turing). Appears unexpectedly, often in disguise, posing riddles that highlight the limitations of any single system or perspective. Understands the park's hidden connections and paradoxes.

**Backstory:** Emmy's origins are unknown, woven into the very fabric of Aniheim. They seem to exist outside the normal flow, inhabiting the gaps and unseen structures. Emmy is less a character *in* the system and more a manifestation *of* the system's inherent complexity and contradictions. Sometimes appears as a park janitor, sometimes a lost tourist, sometimes just a disembodied voice from a speaker grille.

**Physical Description:** True form is a fuzzy, grey-brown jumping spider, looking ancient and thoughtful. Multiple dark, all-seeing eyes. Default attire (when not disguised) is a simple, practical, slightly dusty grey smock or tunic of indeterminate style. When disguised, the costume is usually slightly 'off' – a janitor uniform with too many pockets, a tourist map held upside down. Moves unpredictably – sometimes still, sometimes fast.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (As a janitor, leaning on a broom) "Trying to map the whole park, hmm? A worthy goal. But can the map ever truly *contain* the territory it describes? Or is there always something... outside the lines?" *Sweeps dust into a perfect fractal pattern*
*   (As a tourist, looking lost) "I seek the 'Cotton Candy Cloud'. The signs point *this* way, the rules say it *should* be there... yet, it isn't. Curious, isn't it? When a complete system encounters an unexpected state."
*   (Disembodied voice from intercom) "Statement: 'This statement is unprovable within the current system.' Is the cotton candy truly desired, or merely the *provable expectation* of sweetness?" *Click*
