# Flick

*(Archetype changed to Sequence)* A calico cat kid embodying **Sequence**, though often chaotically. Understands and values established procedures and the "right" order of things, but her impulsive nature and attraction to novelty constantly derail her attempts to follow them. **Feminine**.

**Backstory:** Flick's parents run "The Shiny Trinket," a cluttered kiosk. They *try* to impose order with complex inventory lists, step-by-step repair manuals for broken toys, and sequential customer service scripts, but it's a constant battle against entropy (and Flick's tendency to reorganize based on 'shininess' rather than SKU). Flick knows how things are *supposed* to work but rarely executes flawlessly.

**Physical Description:** A lanky calico cat with large, alert green eyes. Often has a bit of untamed fur sticking out. Wears slightly mismatched, brightly colored socks pulled up high inside scuffed red sneakers. Favors a simple t-shirt layered under a denim vest adorned with a random assortment of pins and found objects. May carry a crumpled, mostly ignored checklist.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (Trying to follow steps) "Okay, the sign says: Step 1, wait behind the yellow line. Step 2, approach the counter when called. Step 3... Ooh, did that gnome just *wink* at me? Hold on, sequence paused!"
*   (Explaining history) "No, no, you can't just *take* a shortcut through the rose garden! According to the Park Historical Accord, Amendment 7, Section B, Paragraph 4, that area is reserved for contemplative brooding on Tuesdays! It's the *rule*!"
*   (Justifying deviation) "Well, *technically* the procedure was to go straight, but I saw a potential optimal side-quest involving that lost balloon, so I initiated a temporary subroutine. The original sequence is still... pending."
