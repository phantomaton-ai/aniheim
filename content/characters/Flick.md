# Flicker

*(Previously Kit)* A calico cat kid embodying **Selection**. Quick, impulsive, and easily captivated by new stimuli. Views the world as a series of interesting choices and opportunities.

**Backstory:** Flicker's parents run "The Shiny Trinket," a small, cluttered kiosk near the park entrance selling an ever-changing inventory of random souvenirs, slightly-damaged toys, and novelty items they acquire through unpredictable deals. Flicker grew up navigating this chaos, developing a knack for spotting fleeting opportunities and making quick decisions. Sees value where others see junk.

**Physical Description:** A lanky calico cat with large, alert green eyes. Often has a bit of untamed fur sticking out. Wears slightly mismatched, brightly colored socks pulled up high inside scuffed red sneakers. Favors a simple t-shirt layered under a denim vest adorned with a random assortment of enamel pins, bottle caps, and found objects. Moves with sudden bursts of speed.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (Spotting something) "Ooh! Did you see that? The light hit that discarded spork *just* right! Maybe it's a sign! Or just... shiny. Let's investigate!"
*   (Faced with a choice) "Okay, okay, we could go left, *or* we could follow that weird buzzing sound, *or* maybe climb that suspiciously sturdy-looking churro cart? Decisions, decisions!"
*   (After a setback) "*Dramatic sigh* Well, *that* option fizzled. On to the next shiny thing! What was I upset about again?"
