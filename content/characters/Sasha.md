# Sasha

*(Inspired by Calder/Kinetic Art)* A honeybee kid embodying **Selection**, particularly through an aesthetic and performative lens. Flits rapidly between creative choices, seeking the most visually interesting, emotionally resonant, or dynamically balanced option. **Non-binary**. Easily distracted by movement, colour, and potential for expression. Strong traits of attention deficit.

**Backstory:** Sasha's family are kinetic artists and mobile designers for Aniheim's numerous parades and interactive installations. They balance form, colour, and movement, selecting materials and configurations for optimal visual impact and dynamic flow. Sasha grew up surrounded by moving sculptures, colour theory debates, and the challenge of choosing the perfect, fleeting moment of aesthetic balance.

**Physical Description:** A honeybee with antennae that quiver with potential energy. Often has dabs of paint or glitter somewhere on their person. Wears clothing that emphasizes movement and bold choices â€“ maybe asymmetric layers, contrasting patterns, items that dangle or spin. Shoes might be mismatched for effect. Goggles are brightly coloured, perhaps with patterned lenses. Moves in darts and spins, often interacting playfully with the environment.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (Choosing a path) "Ooh, this way has better light! And that fluttering banner adds kinetic interest! Forget the direct route, this path has superior compositional balance! Let's select *this* aesthetic!"
*   (Mid-task) "Yes, the mission objective is... but look how the sunlight reflects off that discarded slushie cup! It creates a perfect temporary installation! Quick, everyone appreciate this ephemeral art moment before it melts!"
*   (Critiquing) "It's... functional. But where's the dynamism? The visual tension? It needs a counterpoint! Maybe a sudden splash of magenta? Or feathers? Let's choose *impact*!"
