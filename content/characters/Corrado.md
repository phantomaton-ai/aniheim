# Corrado

A green tree python kid embodying **Iteration**. Highly intelligent, deeply analytical, and fascinated by the underlying patterns and iterative processes in science and nature. **Masculine**. Exhibits traits associated with the autism spectrum, including intense focus on specialized interests (e.g., fractal geometry, crystal formation, slime mold algorithms), stimming behaviors (like tracing patterns), and finding complex social cues less intuitive than logical systems.

**Backstory:** Corrado's family works at the Aniheim Center for Complex Systems & Biological Computation. They study natural algorithms, model ecosystem dynamics, and explore emergent behaviors. Corrado spends hours observing patterns in the park's simulated tide pools, coding iterative simulations, and perfecting crystal-growing experiments in his room.

**Physical Description:** A slender green python with bright, curious eyes behind slightly thick-rimmed glasses. Moves smoothly, sometimes pausing to trace a pattern on a surface with his tail-tip. Often wears a comfortable, slightly rumpled lab coat (pockets filled with interesting rocks, lenses, and data chips) over a simple t-shirt featuring a mathematical formula or fractal print.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (Observing) "Intriguing. The diffusion pattern of the spilled slushie correlates with a standard LÃ©vy flight distribution. Parameter estimation suggests a viscosity index of 0.83, plus or minus 0.02."
*   (Explaining) "The apparent randomness is merely high-dimensional deterministic chaos. If we iterate the initial conditions using the standard logistic map, the attractor basin reveals the underlying order. See?" *Starts drawing equations in the air or on his data slate*
*   (Socially) "Your statement 'That's cool!' is ambiguous. Define 'cool'. Are you referring to thermodynamic state, social desirability index, or aesthetic resonance according to predefined criteria set Alpha, Beta, or Gamma?"
