# Andy

*(Inspired by Warhol/Pop Art Selection)* A honeybee kid embodying **Selection**, expressed through bold choices, capturing moments, and finding the 'iconic' angle. Flits rapidly between potential compositions, seeking the most striking, memorable, or 'pop' option. **Non-binary**. Easily distracted by strong visual statements and the potential to frame *anything* as art. Strong traits of attention deficit.

**Backstory:** Andy's family runs the "Aniheim Image Factory," a high-volume studio producing stylized souvenir photos, instant caricatures, and promotional posters known for their bright colours and repetitive motifs. They excel at quickly selecting the most marketable angle or iconic representation. Andy grew up amidst silkscreens, photo booths, and the constant selection of the 'fifteen minutes of fame' moment.

**Physical Description:** A honeybee with antennae that seem to vibrate with captured energy. Often has colourful ink smudges on their hands/paws. Wears bold, graphic clothing â€“ think simple shapes, high-contrast colours, maybe a soup-can-print bandana or a pop-art inspired tunic. Shoes are bright, solid-coloured sneakers. Goggles are oversized and round, like camera lenses. Moves with a stop-start energy, framing scenes with their hands.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (Choosing a path) "This way? Boring! That way? Done! *This* way! It has that perfect juxtaposition of industrial decay and ironic floral print! Very now! Very... us! Select *this* frame!"
*   (Mid-task) "Objective acquired! Got the... wow! Look at the repetition of those discarded ticket stubs! So Warholian! Quick, need to document this moment of profound banality! Forget the objective, art calls!"
*   (Critiquing) "It lacks... iconography. It's just a thing. It needs to be *about* something! Select a stronger statement! Make it bold! Make it *pop*!"
