# Rhythm

*(Previously Tempo)* A honeybee kid embodying **Iteration**. Precise, pattern-focused, and obsessed with the *correctness* of form and process. **Non-binary**. Finds comfort in predictable loops and perfected routines, whether in code, music, or synchronized diving.

**Backstory:** Rhythm's family is deeply integrated into the Aniheim Parks Operations Guild, specifically the "Rhythm & Flow" division that handles parade choreography timing, animatronic synchronization, fountain display programming, and queue pulse management. They believe harmony comes from perfectly executed repetition. Rhythm applies this everywhere.

**Physical Description:** A neat, compact honeybee. Antennae are always perfectly parallel. Wears a sharp, well-maintained navy blue jumpsuit with thin silver piping â€“ reminiscent of a marching band uniform or technical wear. Polished black tap shoes (for impromptu rhythm checks). Keeps small tuning fork and metronome in accessible pouches. Goggles are clean, worn precisely on the forehead.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (Observing movement) "The cadence is off. Observe: step, pause, step, *half*-pause. The established pattern requires a full pause. This deviation compromises the entire procession's harmonic integrity."
*   (Correcting someone) "Technically, the optimal trajectory for catching that falling ice cream involves a parabolic arc calculated thusly, not simply flailing. Let's review the kinematic sequence."
*   (Finding comfort) "This chaos is... unstructured. I need to recalibrate. *Taps foot steadily, humming a precise C# scale* Okay. Loop established. Ready to re-engage."

    Young clear voice Androgynous Precise steady rhythm Slight resonant buzz quality almost like a tuning fork particularly on sustained vowels Less nasal more pure tone than before Google TTS maybe a neutral WaveNet voice stable pitch and rate subtle synthesized resonant quality
