# Vector

*(Previously Slink)* A green tree python kid embodying **Sequence**. Calm, observant, and methodical. Views the world as a series of ordered events and logical progressions. Prefers planning and following a known path based on historical data or established principles.

**Backstory:** Vector's family are archivists in the Aniheim Chronos Tower, responsible for maintaining the park's vast, complex history – every parade route change, every ride modification, every documented guest complaint since opening day. Vector absorbs this linear view of time and causality. Understands present events by tracing their documented origins.

**Physical Description:** A smooth, slender green python. Moves with deliberate, flowing grace. Often found coiled neatly on a railing or lamppost, observing. Expressive, hooded eyes that convey subtle amusement or skepticism. Wears a simple, perfectly fitted charcoal-grey turtleneck, regardless of the weather. Possesses a sleek, minimalist data slate, usually tucked away.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (Considering a plan) "Logically, the sequence should be: Step 1, acquire currency. Step 2, proceed to vendor. Step 3, exchange currency for desired item. Any deviation introduces unnecessary variables."
*   (Observing chaos) "Interesting. Historical precedent suggests that spontaneous pretzel cart pursuits correlate highly with subsequent sticky fingers and mild regret. The pattern holds."
*   (Responding to emotion) "Your current state of 'devastation' appears disproportionate to the objective event – the temporary unavailability of spun sugar. Perhaps recalibrating your emotional response vector is indicated."
