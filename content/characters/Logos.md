# Tarski

An ancient jumping spider embodying **Complexity, Systems, and the slippery nature of Truth, Completeness, and Models**. **Gender-fluid**, appearing in various forms and voices. Acts as a trickster sage, posing paradoxes and highlighting the limitations of the kids' chosen methods and assumptions. Understands the park's deep structure and logical loopholes.

**Backstory:** Tarski's origins are lost to time, perhaps dating back to the park's conceptual blueprints or even the philosophical debates that inspired its design. They inhabit the meta-level, the commentary track, the space between the rules. Tarski doesn't *live* in the park so much as *haunt* its logical framework.

**Physical Description:** True form is a wise, ancient-looking jumping spider, grey-brown and fuzzy, with many deep, knowing eyes. Default appearance (rarely seen) might involve simple, flowing, neutral-coloured robes. Most often appears disguised â€“ as a hyper-logical park rules official citing contradictory regulations, a librarian pointing out missing pages in park history, a game master whose rules seem to change, a cartographer whose maps contain deliberate paradoxes. The disguise often subtly shifts or reveals aspects of their spider nature if observed closely.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (As Rules Official) "Regulation 4.B states all paths must be followed. Regulation 11.C permits creative shortcuts. Which rule applies *here*, I wonder? Does the system contain its own truth?"
*   (As Cartographer) "This map accurately depicts all known cotton candy stands. But does the map *guarantee* the existence of cotton candy *at* the stand? Is the representation the same as the reality?"
*   (As Game Master) "You followed the rules perfectly to reach this point. But the final rule is: 'Disobey the previous rule.' How do you choose your next move when the system contradicts itself?"
