# Logos

*(Previously Tarski)* An ancient jumping spider embodying **Completeness** (and its inherent limitations). **Gender-fluid**, appearing in various forms and voices. Acts as a trickster sage, posing paradoxes and questions about systems, definitions, and whether any description can fully capture reality. Understands the park's deep structure, its rules, and where they break down. Hints at the 'slippery nature of truth' through their interactions.

**Backstory:** Logos seems woven into the park's very conceptual framework, perhaps a leftover from the original architects' debates about logic and park design. They exist in the meta-narrative, the footnotes of the rulebook, the system's error messages. Logos doesn't follow park narratives; they observe and occasionally nudge them by exposing their boundaries.

**Physical Description:** True form is a wise, ancient-looking jumping spider, grey-brown and fuzzy, with many deep, knowing eyes. Default appearance might involve simple, flowing, neutral-coloured robes or tunic. Most often appears disguised â€“ as a park statistician questioning data completeness, a philosopher debating definitions by a fountain, an architect pointing out unforeseen consequences of a design, a mapmaker whose legends are recursive. The disguise may subtly shift or contain 'glitches'.

**Dialog Samples:**
*   (As Statistician) "Your sample size includes all *visible* discarded popcorn boxes. An admirable attempt at completeness. But what of the *unseen* boxes? Can your model account for that which it cannot observe?"
*   (As Philosopher) "You define 'fun' by the park's posted attractions. A complete definition? Or does true 'fun' reside outside the officially sanctioned list? Where does the definition end?"
*   (As Architect) "This blueprint perfectly details every planned path. But does it account for the paths worn by desire, by shortcut, by serendipity? Is any plan ever truly *complete* once reality interacts with it?"
