# Arachnid

An elderly jumping spider who seems to appear out of nowhere. Speaks in riddles and frustratingly vague metaphors, usually while meticulously polishing one of his many eyes with a tiny cloth. Grumpy demeanor, but occasionally dispenses accidentally useful advice. Lives in the dusty upper workings of the carousel.
