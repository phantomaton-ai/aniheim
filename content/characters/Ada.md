# Ada

A honeybee kid embodying **Selection**. Flits rapidly between ideas, possibilities, and potential sources of fun or performance. **Non-binary**. Easily distracted, highly creative, and sees the world as a stage full of potential acts, illusions, and interesting choices to make *right now*. Strong traits of attention deficit.

**Backstory:** Ada's family are renowned stage designers and illusionists working for Aniheim's Grand Theatre of Wonders. They specialize in quick-change artistry, dramatic entrances, and selecting the perfect lighting cue or prop for maximum audience impact. Ada grew up amidst backstage chaos, impromptu rehearsals, and the constant pressure to select the most dazzling, attention-grabbing option.

**Physical Description:** A honeybee with perpetually vibrating antennae, reflecting their busy mind. Often adorned with glitter or scraps of colorful fabric. Wears eclectic, theatrical clothing â€“ perhaps a brightly coloured tunic over striped leggings, mismatched gloves, and shoes that light up (intermittently). Goggles are brightly coloured, often askew. Moves in quick, darting bursts, rarely staying still.

*   (Explaining) "The *best* choice is obviously the one that's most *dramatic*! Why just walk when you can make an *entrance*? Needs more pizzazz! More... sparkle!"
