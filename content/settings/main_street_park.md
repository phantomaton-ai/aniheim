# Main Street Park

A small, manicured green space just off the bustling Main Street of Aniheim. Features perfectly round topiaries, a slightly sticky-looking bench, and a perpetually cheerful (and slightly creepy) animatronic flower clock that chimes too often. In the distance, the faint screams and calliope music of the midway can be heard.

    Simple park scene Layered 2D shapes Green ground Blue sky Round green bushes A wooden bench An oversized colorful flower clock Maybe faint rollercoaster silhouettes in background
