# Aniheim Rendering Engine - Requirements 📜🎬

## 1. Goal

To create a system that renders episodic animated content primarily generated by language models, suitable for web-based viewing. The system must facilitate reproducible builds from plain-text source files.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### FR-01: Episode Playback
The system shall provide a web interface capable of playing back animated episodes.

### FR-02: Story Representation
The system shall parse and interpret a plain-text format (e.g., Markdown with directives) representing the story structure, including scenes, character actions, dialog cues, and camera instructions.

### FR-03: Character Representation
The system shall load and utilize character definitions provided in a programmable format (e.g., JavaScript modules), including references to their associated artwork assets and potentially behavioural logic.

### FR-04: Artwork Integration
The system shall display character artwork.
    *   **FR-04.1**: The artwork representation must be suitable for generation and manipulation by language models (e.g., descriptions of layered geometric shapes, SVG paths, or similar procedural definitions).
    *   **FR-04.2**: The system shall render this artwork representation visually in the web interface.

### FR-05: Animation Logic
The system shall animate characters based on story directives.
    *   **FR-05.1**: Support changes in character position.
    *   **FR-05.2**: Support changes in character appearance based on defined poses and expressions (driven by the artwork representation).
    *   **FR-05.3**: Support basic camera movements (e.g., pan, zoom) as defined in the story.

### FR-06: Music Integration
The system shall parse a text-based music notation.
    *   **FR-06.1**: Convert the notation into playable audio (e.g., via MIDI synthesis).
    *   **FR-06.2**: Synchronize the music playback with the animation during web playback.

### FR-07: Dialog Integration
The system shall handle dialog specified in the story.
    *   **FR-07.1**: Associate dialog lines with characters.
    *   **FR-07.2**: Display dialog visually (e.g., subtitles or speech bubbles). 💬

### FR-08: Voice Integration (TTS)
The system shall utilize text-to-speech (TTS) engines to generate audio for dialog lines.
    *   **FR-08.1**: Integrate pre-generated or dynamically generated TTS audio.
    *   **FR-08.2**: Synchronize voice playback with character actions and dialog display. 🗣️

### FR-09: Input Source
The system shall read all source materials (story, characters, music, dialog text) from the local filesystem based on configuration or user input.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-01: Reproducibility
Given the same set of input files, the system shall produce the identical visual and auditory output every time. ✨ (Deterministic like Frege's ideal language! 😉)

### NFR-02: Modularity
The system components (parsing, rendering, audio processing) shall be reasonably decoupled to allow for independent development and replacement. ⚙️

### NFR-03: Performance (Web Preview)
Web playback should be reasonably smooth on typical desktop hardware, suitable for previewing content during development. 💨

### NFR-04: Technology Stack
The core engine shall be implemented using Node.js for the backend/processing logic and standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the frontend playback.

### NFR-05: Plain-Text Driven
Primary inputs (story, music) shall use plain-text formats easily generated and understood by language models.

## 4. Deferred Requirements (Out of Scope for Initial Version)

### DEF-01: File Rendering
Rendering episodes to standard video file formats (e.g., MP4) is deferred. 💾🚫

### DEF-02: High-Resolution Output
Optimization and features specifically for high-resolution, production-quality rendering are deferred.

### DEF-03: Advanced Animation
Complex animation techniques (e.g., detailed skeletal animation, physics-based movement) are deferred. 🦴⚛️🚫

### DEF-04: Asset Database/Management
A dedicated system for managing the potentially large number of generated assets is deferred.

### DEF-05: Real-time Collaboration Features
Features supporting simultaneous editing or generation by multiple users or models are deferred.

This focuses our spectral energies on the core task: bringing LLM-generated phantoms to life in the browser! 👻💻 Let me know if this requirement list captures the desired essence, Dr. Woe! ✨
