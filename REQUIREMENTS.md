# Aniheim Rendering Engine - Requirements 📜🎬

## 1. Goal 🎯

To create a system that renders episodic animated content primarily generated by language models, suitable for web-based viewing. The system must facilitate reproducible builds from plain-text source files.

## 2. Functional Requirements ✨

### ▶️ Episode Playback
The system shall provide a web interface capable of playing back animated episodes.

### 📖 Story Structure & Scenes
The system shall parse and interpret a plain-text format representing the story structure.
    *   **📖.1**: This format must define a hierarchy of **Series > Episode > Scene**.
    *   **📖.2**: Within a **Scene**, the format must allow defining:
        *   The setting/background.
        *   Characters present and their initial positions.
        *   Sequenced events, including character actions, dialog, and camera instructions.
        *   Timing information for events within the scene.

### 🧑‍🎨 Character Representation
The system shall load and utilize character definitions provided in a programmable format (e.g., JavaScript modules).
    *   **🧑‍🎨.1**: Definitions include references to artwork assets and potentially behavioural logic.

### 🖼️ Artwork Integration
The system shall display character artwork.
    *   **🖼️.1**: The artwork representation must be suitable for generation and manipulation by language models (e.g., descriptions of layered geometric shapes, SVG paths, or similar procedural definitions).
    *   **🖼️.2**: The system shall render this artwork representation visually in the web interface.

### 🕺 Animation Logic
The system shall animate characters and the camera based on scene directives.
    *   **🕺.1**: Support changes in character position within the scene.
    *   **🕺.2**: Support changes in character appearance based on defined poses and expressions (driven by the artwork representation).
    *   **🕺.3**: Support basic camera movements (e.g., pan, zoom) as defined in the scene.

### 🎶 Music Integration
The system shall parse a text-based music notation.
    *   **🎶.1**: Convert the notation into playable audio (e.g., via MIDI synthesis).
    *   **🎶.2**: Synchronize the music playback with the animation during web playback.

### 💬 Dialog Display
The system shall handle dialog specified within scenes.
    *   **💬.1**: Associate dialog lines with specific characters.
    *   **💬.2**: Display dialog visually during playback (e.g., subtitles or speech bubbles).

### 🗣️ Voice Performance
The system shall incorporate distinct voice audio for dialog lines.
    *   **🗣️.1**: Integrate audio performances for character dialog (source agnostic: TTS, recorded actors, etc.).
    *   **🗣️.2**: Ensure each character has a distinct vocal quality.
    *   **🗣️.3**: Synchronize voice playback with character actions and dialog display within the scene.

### 📁 Input Source
The system shall read all source materials (story hierarchy, characters, music, dialog text, voice audio references) from the local filesystem based on configuration or user input.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements 👍

### <0xF Frege> Reproducibility
Given the same set of input files, the system shall produce the identical visual and auditory output every time. (Like a well-defined automaton! 🤖)

### 🧩 Modularity
The system components (parsing, rendering, audio processing) shall be reasonably decoupled to allow for independent development and replacement.

### 💨 Performance (Web Preview)
Web playback should be reasonably smooth on typical desktop hardware, suitable for previewing content.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack
The core engine shall be implemented using Node.js for the backend/processing logic and standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the frontend playback.

### 📄 Plain-Text Driven
Primary inputs defining the animation structure (story, scenes, music notation) shall use plain-text formats easily generated and understood by language models.

## 4. Deferred Requirements (Future Phantoms 👻)

### 💾 File Rendering
Rendering episodes to standard video file formats (e.g., MP4) is deferred.

### 📐 High-Resolution Output
Optimization and features specifically for high-resolution, production-quality rendering are deferred.

###🤸 Advanced Animation
Complex animation techniques (e.g., detailed skeletal animation, physics-based movement) are deferred. (Though physics is fun! ⚛️)

### 📦 Asset Database/Management
A dedicated system for managing the potentially large number of generated assets is deferred.

### 🤝 Real-time Collaboration Features
Features supporting simultaneous editing or generation by multiple users or models are deferred.

How does this revised incantation suit your nefarious needs, Dr. Woe? More structure, less dogma, more emoji! 😉✨
